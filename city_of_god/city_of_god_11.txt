                            BOOK ELEVENTH.

                               ARGUMENT.

  HERE BEGINS THE SECOND PART[440] OF THIS WORK, WHICH TREATS OF
      THE ORIGIN, HISTORY, AND DESTINIES OF THE TWO CITIES, THE
      EARTHLY AND THE HEAVENLY. IN THE FIRST PLACE, AUGUSTINE SHOWS
      IN THIS BOOK HOW THE TWO CITIES WERE FORMED ORIGINALLY, BY THE
      SEPARATION OF THE GOOD AND BAD ANGELS; AND TAKES OCCASION TO
      TREAT OF THE CREATION OF THE WORLD, AS IT IS DESCRIBED IN HOLY
      SCRIPTURE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK OF GENESIS.


 1. _Of this part of the work, wherein we begin to explain the origin
                      and end of the two cities._

The city of God we speak of is the same to which testimony is borne
by that Scripture, which excels all the writings of all nations
by its divine authority, and has brought under its influence all
kinds of minds, and this not by a casual intellectual movement, but
obviously by an express providential arrangement. For there it is
written, "Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God."[441]
And in another psalm we read, "Great is the Lord, and greatly to be
praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of His holiness,
increasing the joy of the whole earth."[442] And, a little after, in
the same psalm, "As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the
Lord of hosts, in the city of our God. God has established it for
ever." And in another, "There is a river the streams whereof shall
make glad the city of our God, the holy place of the tabernacles
of the Most High. God is in the midst of her, she shall not be
moved."[443] From these and similar testimonies, all of which it
were tedious to cite, we have learned that there is a city of God,
and its Founder has inspired us with a love which makes us covet its
citizenship. To this Founder of the holy city the citizens of the
earthly city prefer their own gods, not knowing that He is the God
of gods, not of false, _i.e._ of impious and proud gods, who, being
deprived of His unchangeable and freely communicated light, and so
reduced to a kind of poverty-stricken power, eagerly grasp at their
own private privileges, and seek divine honours from their deluded
subjects; but of the pious and holy gods, who are better pleased to
submit themselves to one, than to subject many to themselves, and
who would rather worship God than be worshipped as God. But to the
enemies of this city we have replied in the ten preceding books,
according to our ability and the help afforded by our Lord and King.
Now, recognising what is expected of me, and not unmindful of my
promise, and relying, too, on the same succour, I will endeavour to
treat of the origin, and progress, and deserved destinies of the two
cities (the earthly and the heavenly, to wit), which, as we said, are
in this present world commingled, and as it were entangled together.
And, first, I will explain how the foundations of these two cities
were originally laid, in the difference that arose among the angels.


     2. _Of the knowledge of God, to which no man can attain save
   through the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus._

It is a great and very rare thing for a man, after he has
contemplated the whole creation, corporeal and incorporeal, and has
discerned its mutability, to pass beyond it, and, by the continued
soaring of his mind, to attain to the unchangeable substance of God,
and, in that height of contemplation, to learn from God Himself that
none but He has made all that is not of the divine essence. For God
speaks with a man not by means of some audible creature dinning in
his ears, so that atmospheric vibrations connect Him that makes with
him that hears the sound, nor even by means of a spiritual being
with the semblance of a body, such as we see in dreams or similar
states; for even in this case He speaks as if to the ears of the
body, because it is by means of the semblance of a body He speaks,
and with the appearance of a real interval of space,--for visions are
exact representations of bodily objects. Not by these, then, does God
speak, but by the truth itself, if any one is prepared to hear with
the mind rather than with the body. For He speaks to that part of
man which is better than all else that is in him, and than which God
Himself alone is better. For since man is most properly understood
(or, if that cannot be, then, at least, _believed_) to be made in
God's image, no doubt it is that part of him by which he rises above
those lower parts he has in common with the beasts, which brings him
nearer to the Supreme. But since the mind itself, though naturally
capable of reason and intelligence, is disabled by besotting and
inveterate vices not merely from delighting and abiding in, but even
from tolerating His unchangeable light, until it has been gradually
healed, and renewed, and made capable of such felicity, it had, in
the first place, to be impregnated with faith, and so purified. And
that in this faith it might advance the more confidently towards the
truth, the truth itself, God, God's Son, assuming humanity without
destroying His divinity,[444] established and founded this faith,
that there might be a way for man to man's God through a God-man. For
this is the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. For
it is as man that He is the Mediator and the Way. Since, if the way
lieth between him who goes, and the place whither he goes, there is
hope of his reaching it; but if there be no way, or if he know not
where it is, what boots it to know whither he should go? Now the only
way that is infallibly secured against all mistakes, is when the very
same person is at once God and man, God our end, man our way.[445]


   3. _Of the authority of the canonical Scriptures composed by the
                            Divine Spirit._

This Mediator, having spoken what He judged sufficient, first by
the prophets, then by His own lips, and afterwards by the apostles,
has besides produced the Scripture which is called canonical,
which has paramount authority, and to which we yield assent in all
matters of which we ought not to be ignorant, and yet cannot know
of ourselves. For if we attain the knowledge of present objects by
the testimony of our own senses,[446] whether internal or external,
then, regarding objects remote from our own senses, we need others
to bring their testimony, since we cannot know them by our own, and
we credit the persons to whom the objects have been or are sensibly
present. Accordingly, as in the case of visible objects which we have
not seen, we trust those who have, (and likewise with all sensible
objects,) so in the case of things which are perceived[447] by the
mind and spirit, _i.e._ which are remote from our own interior
sense, it behoves us to trust those who have seen them set in that
incorporeal light, or abidingly contemplate them.


  4. _That the world is neither without beginning, nor yet created
      by a new decree of God, by which He afterwards willed what He
      had not before willed._

Of all visible things, the world is the greatest; of all invisible,
the greatest is God. But, that the world is, we see; that God is, we
believe. That God made the world, we can believe from no one more
safely than from God Himself. But where have we heard Him? Nowhere
more distinctly than in the Holy Scriptures, where His prophet said,
"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."[448] Was
the prophet present when God made the heavens and the earth? No; but
the wisdom of God, by whom all things were made, was there,[449] and
wisdom insinuates itself into holy souls, and makes them the friends
of God and His prophets, and noiselessly informs them of His works.
They are taught also by the angels of God, who always behold the face
of the Father,[450] and announce His will to whom it befits. Of these
prophets was he who said and wrote, "In the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth." And so fit a witness was he of God, that the
same Spirit of God, who revealed these things to him, enabled him also
so long before to predict that our faith also would be forthcoming.

But why did God choose then to create the heavens and earth which
up to that time He had not made?[451] If they who put this question
wish to make out that the world is eternal and without beginning, and
that consequently it has not been made by God, they are strangely
deceived, and rave in the incurable madness of impiety. For, though
the voices of the prophets were silent, the world itself, by its
well-ordered changes and movements, and by the fair appearance of
all visible things, bears a testimony of its own, both that it has
been created, and also that it could not have been created save by
God, whose greatness and beauty are unutterable and invisible. As
for those[452] who own, indeed, that it was made by God, and yet
ascribe to it not a temporal but only a creational beginning, so
that in some scarcely intelligible way the world should always have
existed a created world, they make an assertion which seems to them
to defend God from the charge of arbitrary hastiness, or of suddenly
conceiving the idea of creating the world as a quite new idea, or
of casually changing His will, though He be unchangeable. But I do
not see how this supposition of theirs can stand in other respects,
and chiefly in respect of the soul; for if they contend that it is
co-eternal with God, they will be quite at a loss to explain whence
there has accrued to it new misery, which through a previous eternity
had not existed. For if they said that its happiness and misery
ceaselessly alternate, they must say, further, that this alternation
will continue for ever; whence will result this absurdity, that,
though the soul is called blessed, it is not so in this, that it
foresees its own misery and disgrace. And yet, if it does not foresee
it, and supposes that it will be neither disgraced nor wretched, but
always blessed, then it is blessed because it is deceived; and a more
foolish statement one cannot make. But if their idea is that the
soul's misery has alternated with its bliss during the ages of the
past eternity, but that now, when once the soul has been set free,
it will return henceforth no more to misery, they are nevertheless
of opinion that it has never been truly blessed before, but begins
at last to enjoy a new and uncertain happiness; that is to say,
they must acknowledge that some new thing, and that an important
and signal thing, happens to the soul which never in a whole past
eternity happened it before. And if they deny that God's eternal
purpose included this new experience of the soul, they deny that He
is the Author of its blessedness, which is unspeakable impiety.
If, on the other hand, they say that the future blessedness of the
soul is the result of a new decree of God, how will they show that
God is not chargeable with that mutability which displeases them?
Further, if they acknowledge that it was created in time, but will
never perish in time,--that it has, like number,[453] a beginning
but no end,--and that, therefore, having once made trial of misery,
and been delivered from it, it will never again return thereto, they
will certainly admit that this takes place without any violation of
the immutable counsel of God. Let them, then, in like manner believe
regarding the world that it too could be made in time, and yet that
God, in making it, did not alter His eternal design.


   5. _That we ought not to seek to comprehend the infinite ages of
       time before the world, nor the infinite realms of space._

Next, we must see what reply can be made to those who agree that God
is the Creator of the world, but have difficulties about the time of
its creation, and what reply, also, they can make to difficulties
we might raise about the place of its creation. For, as they demand
why the world was created then and no sooner, we may ask why it
was created just here where it is, and not elsewhere. For if they
imagine infinite spaces of time before the world, during which God
could not have been idle, in like manner they may conceive outside
the world infinite realms of space, in which, if any one says that
the Omnipotent cannot hold His hand from working, will it not follow
that they must adopt Epicurus' dream of innumerable worlds? with
this difference only, that he asserts that they are formed and
destroyed by the fortuitous movements of atoms, while they will hold
that they are made by God's hand, if they maintain that, throughout
the boundless immensity of space, stretching interminably in every
direction round the world, God cannot rest, and that the worlds which
they suppose Him to make cannot be destroyed. For here the question
is with those who, with ourselves, believe that God is spiritual,
and the Creator of all existences but Himself. As for others, it
is a condescension to dispute with them on a religious question,
for they have acquired a reputation only among men who pay divine
honours to a number of gods, and have become conspicuous among the
other philosophers for no other reason than that, though they are
still far from the truth, they are near it in comparison with the
rest. While these, then, neither confine in any place, nor limit, nor
distribute the divine substance, but, as is worthy of God, own it to
be wholly though spiritually present everywhere, will they perchance
say that this substance is absent from such immense spaces outside
the world, and is occupied in one only, (and that a very little one
compared with the infinity beyond,) the one, namely, in which is
the world? I think they will not proceed to this absurdity. Since
they maintain that there is but one world, of vast material bulk,
indeed, yet finite, and in its own determinate position, and that
this was made by the working of God, let them give the same account
of God's resting in the infinite times before the world as they
give of His resting in the infinite spaces outside of it. And as it
does not follow that God set the world in the very spot it occupies
and no other by accident rather than by divine reason, although no
human reason can comprehend why it was so set, and though there was
no merit in the spot chosen to give it the precedence of infinite
others, so neither does it follow that we should suppose that God was
guided by chance when He created the world in that and no earlier
time, although previous times had been running by during an infinite
past, and though there was no difference by which one time could be
chosen in preference to another. But if they say that the thoughts
of men are idle when they conceive infinite places, since there is
no place beside the world, we reply that, by the same showing, it is
vain to conceive of the past times of God's rest, since there is no
time before the world.


    6. _That the world and time had both one beginning, and the one
                    did not anticipate the other._

For if eternity and time are rightly distinguished by this, that
time does not exist without some movement and transition, while in
eternity there is no change, who does not see that there could have
been no time had not some creature been made, which by some motion
could give birth to change,--the various parts of which motion and
change, as they cannot be simultaneous, succeed one another,--and
thus, in these shorter or longer intervals of duration, time would
begin? Since then, God, in whose eternity is no change at all, is the
Creator and Ordainer of time, I do not see how He can be said to have
created the world after spaces of time had elapsed, unless it be said
that prior to the world there was some creature by whose movement
time could pass. And if the sacred and infallible Scriptures say that
in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, in order that
it may be understood that He had made nothing previously,--for if He
had made anything before the rest, this thing would rather be said
to have been made "in the beginning,"--then assuredly the world was
made, not in time, but simultaneously with time. For that which is
made in time is made both after and before some time,--after that
which is past, before that which is future. But none could then be
past, for there was no creature by whose movements its duration could
be measured. But simultaneously with time the world was made, if in
the world's creation change and motion were created, as seems evident
from the order of the first six or seven days. For in these days the
morning and evening are counted, until, on the sixth day, all things
which God then made were finished, and on the seventh the rest of
God was mysteriously and sublimely signalized. What kind of days
these were it is extremely difficult, or perhaps impossible for us to
conceive, and how much more to say!


    7. _Of the nature of the first days, which are said to have had
             morning and evening, before there was a sun._

We see, indeed, that our ordinary days have no evening but by the
setting, and no morning but by the rising, of the sun; but the first
three days of all were passed without sun, since it is reported to have
been made on the fourth day. And first of all, indeed, light was made
by the word of God, and God, we read, separated it from the darkness,
and called the light Day, and the darkness Night; but what kind of
light that was, and by what periodic movement it made evening and
morning, is beyond the reach of our senses; neither can we understand
how it was, and yet must unhesitatingly believe it. For either it was
some material light, whether proceeding from the upper parts of the
world, far removed from our sight, or from the spot where the sun
was afterwards kindled; or under the name of light the holy city was
signified, composed of holy angels and blessed spirits, the city of
which the apostle says, "Jerusalem which is above is our eternal mother
in heaven;"[454] and in another place, "For ye are all the children of
the light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of
darkness."[455] Yet in some respects we may appropriately speak of a
morning and evening of this day also. For the knowledge of the creature
is, in comparison of the knowledge of the Creator, but a twilight; and
so it dawns and breaks into morning when the creature is drawn to the
praise and love of the Creator; and night never falls when the Creator
is not forsaken through love of the creature. In fine, Scripture, when
it would recount those days in order, never mentions the word night.
It never says, "Night was," but "The evening and the morning were the
first day." So of the second and the rest. And, indeed, the knowledge
of created things contemplated by themselves is, so to speak, more
colourless than when they are seen in the wisdom of God, as in the art
by which they were made. Therefore evening is a more suitable figure
than night; and yet, as I said, morning returns when the creature
returns to the praise and love of the Creator. When it does so in the
knowledge of itself, that is the first day; when in the knowledge of
the firmament, which is the name given to the sky between the waters
above and those beneath, that is the second day; when in the knowledge
of the earth, and the sea, and all things that grow out of the earth,
that is the third day; when in the knowledge of the greater and less
luminaries, and all the stars, that is the fourth day; when in the
knowledge of all animals that swim in the waters and that fly in the
air, that is the fifth day; when in the knowledge of all animals that
live on the earth, and of man himself, that is the sixth day.[456]


  8. _What we are to understand of God's resting on the seventh day,
                      after the six days' work._

When it is said that God rested on the seventh day from all His
works, and hallowed it, we are not to conceive of this in a
childish fashion, as if work were a toil to God, who "spake and it
was done,"--spake by the spiritual and eternal, not audible and
transitory word. But God's rest signifies the rest of those who rest
in God, as the joy of a house means the joy of those in the house
who rejoice, though not the house, but something else, causes the
joy. How much more intelligible is such phraseology, then, if the
house itself, by its own beauty, makes the inhabitants joyful! For
in this case we not only call it joyful by that figure of speech in
which the thing containing is used for the thing contained (as when
we say, "The theatres applaud," "The meadows low," meaning that the
men in the one applaud, and the oxen in the other low), but also by
that figure in which the cause is spoken of as if it were the effect,
as when a letter is said to be joyful, because it makes its readers
so. Most appropriately, therefore, the sacred narrative states that
God rested, meaning thereby that those rest who are in Him, and whom
He makes to rest. And this the prophetic narrative promises also to
the men to whom it speaks, and for whom it was written, that they
themselves, after those good works which God does in and by them, if
they have managed by faith to get near to God in this life, shall
enjoy in Him eternal rest. This was prefigured to the ancient people
of God by the rest enjoined in their sabbath law, of which, in its
own place, I shall speak more at large.


  9. _What the Scriptures teach us to believe concerning the creation
                            of the angels._

At present, since I have undertaken to treat of the origin of the holy
city, and first of the holy angels, who constitute a large part of this
city, and indeed the more blessed part, since they have never been
expatriated, I will give myself to the task of explaining, by God's
help, and as far as seems suitable, the Scriptures which relate to
this point. Where Scripture speaks of the world's creation, it is not
plainly said whether or when the angels were created; but if mention
of them is made, it is implicitly under the name of "heaven," when it
is said, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,"
or perhaps rather under the name of "light," of which presently. But
that they were wholly omitted, I am unable to believe, because it is
written that God on the seventh day rested from all His works which
He made; and this very book itself begins, "In the beginning God
created the heavens and the earth," so that before heaven and earth
God seems to have made nothing. Since, therefore, He began with the
heavens and the earth,--and the earth itself, as Scripture adds, was
at first invisible and formless, light not being as yet made, and
darkness covering the face of the deep (that is to say, covering an
undefined chaos of earth and sea, for where light is not, darkness must
needs be),--and then when all things, which are recorded to have been
completed in six days, were created and arranged, how should the angels
be omitted, as if they were not among the works of God, from which on
the seventh day He rested? Yet, though the fact that the angels are the
work of God is not omitted here, it is indeed not explicitly mentioned;
but elsewhere Holy Scripture asserts it in the clearest manner. For
in the Hymn of the Three Children in the Furnace it was said, "O all
ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord;"[457] and among these works
mentioned afterwards in detail, the angels are named. And in the psalm
it is said, "Praise ye the Lord from the heavens, praise Him in the
heights. Praise ye Him, all His angels; praise ye Him, all His hosts.
Praise ye Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all ye stars of light. Praise
Him, ye heaven of heavens; and ye waters that be above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the Lord; for He commanded, and they
were created."[458] Here the angels are most expressly and by divine
authority said to have been made by God, for of them among the other
heavenly things it is said, "He commanded, and they were created."
Who, then, will be bold enough to suggest that the angels were made
after the six days' creation? If any one is so foolish, his folly is
disposed of by a scripture of like authority, where God says, "When the
stars were made, the angels praised me with a loud voice."[459] The
angels therefore existed before the stars; and the stars were made the
fourth day. Shall we then say that they were made the third day? Far
from it; for we know what was made that day. The earth was separated
from the water, and each element took its own distinct form, and the
earth produced all that grows on it. On the second day, then? Not even
on this; for on it the firmament was made between the waters above and
beneath, and was called "Heaven," in which firmament the stars were
made on the fourth day. There is no question, then, that if the angels
are included in the works of God during these six days, they are that
light which was called "Day," and whose unity Scripture signalizes
by calling that day not the "first day," but "one day."[460] For the
second day, the third, and the rest are not other days; but the same
"one" day is repeated to complete the number six or seven, so that
there should be knowledge both of God's works and of His rest. For
when God said, "Let there be light, and there was light," if we are
justified in understanding in this light the creation of the angels,
then certainly they were created partakers of the eternal light which
is the unchangeable Wisdom of God, by which all things were made,
and whom we call the only-begotten Son of God; so that they, being
illumined by the Light that created them, might themselves become light
and be called "Day," in participation of that unchangeable Light and
Day which is the Word of God, by whom both themselves and all else were
made. "The true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the
world,"[461]--this Light lighteth also every pure angel, that he may
be light not in himself, but in God; from whom if an angel turn away,
he becomes impure, as are all those who are called unclean spirits,
and are no longer light in the Lord, but darkness in themselves,
being deprived of the participation of Light eternal. For evil has no
positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name "evil."[462]


  10. _Of the simple and unchangeable Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy
     Ghost, one God, in whom substance and quality are identical._

There is, accordingly, a good which is alone simple, and therefore
alone unchangeable, and this is God. By this Good have all others
been created, but not simple, and therefore not unchangeable.
"Created," I say,--that is, made, not begotten. For that which is
begotten of the simple Good is simple as itself, and the same as
itself. These two we call the Father and the Son; and both together
with the Holy Spirit are one God; and to this Spirit the epithet Holy
is in Scripture, as it were, appropriated. And He is another than
the Father and the Son, for He is neither the Father nor the Son.
I say "another," not "another thing," because He is equally with
them the simple Good, unchangeable and co-eternal. And this Trinity
is one God; and none the less simple because a Trinity. For we do
not say that the nature of the good is simple, because the Father
alone possesses it, or the Son alone, or the Holy Ghost alone; nor
do we say, with the Sabellian heretics, that it is only nominally a
Trinity, and has no real distinction of persons; but we say it is
simple, because it is what it has, with the exception of the relation
of the persons to one another. For, in regard to this relation, it is
true that the Father has a Son, and yet is not Himself the Son; and
the Son has a Father, and is not Himself the Father. But, as regards
Himself, irrespective of relation to the other, each is what He has;
thus, He is in Himself living, for He has life, and is Himself the
Life which He has.

It is for this reason, then, that the nature of the Trinity is
called simple, because it has not anything which it can lose, and
because it is not one thing and its contents another, as a cup and
the liquor, or a body and its colour, or the air and the light or
heat of it, or a mind and its wisdom. For none of these is what it
has: the cup is not liquor, nor the body colour, nor the air light
and heat, nor the mind wisdom. And hence they can be deprived of
what they have, and can be turned or changed into other qualities
and states, so that the cup may be emptied of the liquid of which
it is full, the body be discoloured, the air darken, the mind grow
silly. The incorruptible body which is promised to the saints in
the resurrection cannot, indeed, lose its quality of incorruption,
but the bodily substance and the quality of incorruption are not
the same thing. For the quality of incorruption resides entire in
each several part, not greater in one and less in another; for
no part is more incorruptible than another. The body, indeed, is
itself greater in whole than in part; and one part of it is larger,
another smaller, yet is not the larger more incorruptible than the
smaller. The body, then, which is not in each of its parts a whole
body, is one thing; incorruptibility, which is throughout complete,
is another thing;--for every part of the incorruptible body,
however unequal to the rest otherwise, is equally incorrupt. For
the hand, _e.g._, is not more incorrupt than the finger because it
is larger than the finger; so, though finger and hand are unequal,
their incorruptibility is equal. Thus, although incorruptibility is
inseparable from an incorruptible body, yet the substance of the body
is one thing, the quality of incorruption another. And therefore the
body is not what it has. The soul itself, too, though it be always
wise (as it will be eternally when it is redeemed), will be so by
participating in the unchangeable wisdom, which it is not; for though
the air be never robbed of the light that is shed abroad in it, it is
not on that account the same thing as the light. I do not mean that
the soul is air, as has been supposed by some who could not conceive
a spiritual nature;[463] but, with much dissimilarity, the two things
have a kind of likeness, which makes it suitable to say that the
immaterial soul is illumined with the immaterial light of the simple
wisdom of God, as the material air is irradiated with material light,
and that, as the air, when deprived of this light, grows dark, (for
material darkness is nothing else than air wanting light,[464]) so
the soul, deprived of the light of wisdom, grows dark.

According to this, then, those things which are essentially and truly
divine are called simple, because in them quality and substance
are identical, and because they are divine, or wise, or blessed in
themselves, and without extraneous supplement. In Holy Scripture, it
is true, the Spirit of wisdom is called "manifold"[465] because it
contains many things in it; but what it contains it also is, and it
being one is all these things. For neither are there many wisdoms,
but one, in which are untold and infinite treasures of things
intellectual, wherein are all invisible and unchangeable reasons of
things visible and changeable which were created by it.[466] For God
made nothing unwittingly; not even a human workman can be said to do
so. But if He knew all that He made, He made only those things which
He had known. Whence flows a very striking but true conclusion, that
this world could not be known to us unless it existed, but could not
have existed unless it had been known to God.


  11. _Whether the angels that fell partook of the blessedness which
 the holy angels have always enjoyed from the time of their creation._

And since these things are so, those spirits whom we call angels were
never at any time or in any way darkness, but, as soon as they were
made, were made light; yet they were not so created in order that
they might exist and live in any way whatever, but were enlightened
that they might live wisely and blessedly. Some of them, having
turned away from this light, have not won this wise and blessed life,
which is certainly eternal, and accompanied with the sure confidence
of its eternity; but they have still the life of reason, though
darkened with folly, and this they cannot lose, even if they would.
But who can determine to what extent they were partakers of that
wisdom before they fell? And how shall we say that they participated
in it equally with those who through it are truly and fully blessed,
resting in a true certainty of eternal felicity? For if they had
equally participated in this true knowledge, then the evil angels
would have remained eternally blessed equally with the good, because
they were equally expectant of it. For, though a life be never so
long, it cannot be truly called eternal if it is destined to have
an end; for it is called life inasmuch as it is lived, but eternal
because it has no end. Wherefore, although everything eternal is not
therefore blessed (for hell-fire is eternal), yet if no life can be
truly and perfectly blessed except it be eternal, the life of these
angels was not blessed, for it was doomed to end, and therefore not
eternal, whether they knew it or not. In the one case fear, in the
other ignorance, prevented them from being blessed. And even if
their ignorance was not so great as to breed in them a wholly false
expectation, but left them wavering in uncertainty whether their
good would be eternal or would some time terminate, this very doubt
concerning so grand a destiny was incompatible with the plenitude
of blessedness which we believe the holy angels enjoyed. For we do
not so narrow and restrict the application of the term "blessedness"
as to apply it to God only,[467] though doubtless He is so truly
blessed that greater blessedness cannot be; and, in comparison of His
blessedness, what is that of the angels, though, according to their
capacity, they be perfectly blessed?


  12. _A comparison of the blessedness of the righteous, who have not
      yet received the divine reward, with that of our first parents
      in paradise._

And the angels are not the only members of the rational and
intellectual creation whom we call blessed. For who will take upon him
to deny that those first men in Paradise were blessed previously to
sin, although they were uncertain how long their blessedness was to
last, and whether it would be eternal (and eternal it would have been
had they not sinned),--who, I say, will do so, seeing that even now we
not unbecomingly call those blessed whom we see leading a righteous
and holy life in hope of immortality, who have no harrowing remorse of
conscience, but obtain readily divine remission of the sins of their
present infirmity? These, though they are certain that they shall be
rewarded if they persevere, are not certain that they will persevere.
For what man can know that he will persevere to the end in the exercise
and increase of grace, unless he has been certified by some revelation
from Him who, in His just and secret judgment, while He deceives none,
informs few regarding this matter? Accordingly, so far as present
comfort goes, the first man in Paradise was more blessed than any just
man in this insecure state; but as regards the hope of future good,
every man who not merely supposes, but certainly knows that he shall
eternally enjoy the most high God in the company of angels, and beyond
the reach of ill,--this man, no matter what bodily torments afflict
him, is more blessed than was he who, even in that great felicity of
Paradise, was uncertain of his fate.[468]


  13. _Whether all the angels were so created in one common state of
      felicity, that those who fell were not aware that they would
      fall, and that those who stood received assurance of their own
      perseverance after the ruin of the fallen._

From all this, it will readily occur to any one that the blessedness
which an intelligent being desires as its legitimate object results
from a combination of these two things, namely, that it uninterruptedly
enjoy the unchangeable good, which is God; and that it be delivered
from all dubiety, and know certainly that it shall eternally abide in
the same enjoyment. That it is so with the angels of light we piously
believe; but that the fallen angels, who by their own default lost that
light, did not enjoy this blessedness even before they sinned, reason
bids us conclude. Yet if their life was of any duration before they
fell, we must allow them a blessedness of some kind, though not that
which is accompanied with foresight. Or, if it seems hard to believe
that, when the angels were created, some were created in ignorance
either of their perseverance or their fall, while others were most
certainly assured of the eternity of their felicity,--if it is hard to
believe that they were not all from the beginning on an equal footing,
until these who are now evil did of their own will fall away from the
light of goodness, certainly it is much harder to believe that the
holy angels are now uncertain of their eternal blessedness, and do
not know regarding themselves as much as we have been able to gather
regarding them from the Holy Scriptures. For what catholic Christian
does not know that no new devil will ever arise among the good angels,
as he knows that this present devil will never again return into
the fellowship of the good? For the truth in the gospel promises to
the saints and the faithful that they will be equal to the angels of
God; and it is also promised them that they will "go away into life
eternal."[469] But if we are certain that we shall never lapse from
eternal felicity, while they are not certain, then we shall not be
their equals, but their superiors. But as the truth never deceives, and
as we shall be their equals, they must be certain of their blessedness.
And because the evil angels could not be certain of that, since their
blessedness was destined to come to an end, it follows either that the
angels were unequal, or that, if equal, the good angels were assured of
the eternity of their blessedness after the perdition of the others;
unless, possibly, some one may say that the words of the Lord about
the devil, "He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the
truth,"[470] are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer
from the beginning of the human race, when man, whom he could kill by
his deceit, was made, but also that he did not abide in the truth from
the time of his own creation, and was accordingly never blessed with
the holy angels, but refused to submit to his Creator, and proudly
exulted as if in a private lordship of his own, and was thus deceived
and deceiving. For the dominion of the Almighty cannot be eluded;
and he who will not piously submit himself to things as they are,
proudly feigns, and mocks himself with a state of things that does
not exist; so that what the blessed Apostle John says thus becomes
intelligible: "The devil sinneth from the beginning,"[471]--that is,
from the time he was created he refused righteousness which none but a
will piously subject to God can enjoy. Whoever adopts this opinion at
least disagrees with those heretics the Manichees, and with any other
pestilential sect that may suppose that the devil has derived from some
adverse evil principle a nature proper to himself. These persons are so
befooled by error, that, although they acknowledge with ourselves the
authority of the gospels, they do not notice that the Lord did not say,
"The devil was naturally a stranger to the truth," but "The devil abode
not in the truth," by which He meant us to understand that he had
fallen from the truth, in which, if he had abode, he would have become
a partaker of it, and have remained in blessedness along with the holy
angels.[472]


   14. _An explanation of what is said of the devil, that he did not
        abide in the truth, because the truth was not in him._

Moreover, as if we had been inquiring why the devil did not abide in
the truth, our Lord subjoins the reason, saying, "because the truth
is not in him." Now, it would be in him had he abode in it. But the
phraseology is unusual. For, as the words stand, "He abode not in the
truth, because the truth is not in him," it seems as if the truth's
not being in him were the cause of his not abiding in it; whereas his
not abiding in the truth is rather the cause of its not being in him.
The same form of speech is found in the psalm: "I have called upon
Thee, for Thou hast heard me, O God,"[473] where we should expect it
to be said, Thou hast heard me, O God, for I have called upon Thee.
But when he had said, "I have called," then, as if some one were
seeking proof of this, he demonstrates the effectual earnestness of
his prayer by the effect of God's hearing it; as if he had said, The
proof that I have prayed is that Thou hast heard me.


   15. _How we are to understand the words, "The devil sinneth from
                           the beginning."_

As for what John says about the devil, "The devil sinneth from the
beginning,"[474] they[475] who suppose it is meant hereby that the
devil was made with a sinful nature, misunderstand it; for if sin be
natural, it is not sin at all. And how do they answer the prophetic
proofs,--either what Isaiah says when he represents the devil under
the person of the king of Babylon, "How art thou fallen, O Lucifer,
son of the morning!"[476] or what Ezekiel says, "Thou hast been in
Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering,"[477]
where it is meant that he was some time without sin; for a little
after it is still more explicitly said, "Thou wast perfect in thy
ways?" And if these passages cannot well be otherwise interpreted,
we must understand by this one also, "He abode not in the truth,"
that he was once in the truth, but did not remain in it. And from
this passage, "The devil sinneth from the beginning," it is not
to be supposed that he sinned from the beginning of his created
existence, but from the beginning of his sin, when by his pride he
had once commenced to sin. There is a passage, too, in the Book of
Job, of which the devil is the subject: "This is the beginning of the
creation of God, which He made to be a sport to His angels,"[478]
which agrees with the psalm, where it is said, "There is that
dragon which Thou hast made to be a sport therein."[479] But these
passages are not to lead us to suppose that the devil was originally
created to be the sport of the angels, but that he was doomed to
this punishment after his sin. His beginning, then, is the handiwork
of God; for there is no nature, even among the least, and lowest,
and last of the beasts, which was not the work of Him from whom has
proceeded all measure, all form, all order, without which nothing can
be planned or conceived. How much more, then, is this angelic nature,
which surpasses in dignity all else that He has made, the handiwork
of the Most High!


   16. _Of the ranks and differences of the creatures, estimated by
   their utility, or according to the natural gradations of being._

For, among those beings which exist, and which are not of God
the Creator's essence, those which have life are ranked above
those which have none; those that have the power of generation,
or even of desiring, above those which want this faculty. And,
among things that have life, the sentient are higher than those
which have no sensation, as animals are ranked above trees. And,
among the sentient, the intelligent are above those that have not
intelligence,--men, _e.g._, above cattle. And, among the intelligent,
the immortal, such as the angels, above the mortal, such as men.
These are the gradations according to the order of nature; but
according to the utility each man finds in a thing, there are various
standards of value, so that it comes to pass that we prefer some
things that have no sensation to some sentient beings. And so strong
is this preference, that, had we the power, we would abolish the
latter from nature altogether, whether in ignorance of the place they
hold in nature, or, though we know it, sacrificing them to our own
convenience. Who, _e.g._, would not rather have bread in his house
than mice, gold than fleas? But there is little to wonder at in
this, seeing that even when valued by men themselves (whose nature
is certainly of the highest dignity), more is often given for a
horse than for a slave, for a jewel than for a maid. Thus the reason
of one contemplating nature prompts very different judgments from
those dictated by the necessity of the needy, or the desire of the
voluptuous; for the former considers what value a thing in itself has
in the scale of creation, while necessity considers how it meets its
need; reason looks for what the mental light will judge to be true,
while pleasure looks for what pleasantly titillates the bodily sense.
But of such consequence in rational natures is the weight, so to
speak, of will and of love, that though in the order of nature angels
rank above men, yet, by the scale of justice, good men are of greater
value than bad angels.


    17. _That the flaw of wickedness is not nature, but contrary to
   nature, and has its origin, not in the Creator, but in the will._

It is with reference to the nature, then, and not to the wickedness
of the devil, that we are to understand these words, "This is the
beginning of God's handiwork;"[480] for, without doubt, wickedness
can be a flaw or vice[481] only where the nature previously was not
vitiated. Vice, too, is so contrary to nature, that it cannot but
damage it. And therefore departure from God would be no vice, unless
in a nature whose property it was to abide with God. So that even
the wicked will is a strong proof of the goodness of the nature. But
God, as He is the supremely good Creator of good natures, so is He of
evil wills the most just Ruler; so that, while they make an ill use
of good natures, He makes a good use even of evil wills. Accordingly,
He caused the devil (good by God's creation, wicked by his own will)
to be cast down from his high position, and to become the mockery
of His angels,--that is, He caused his temptations to benefit those
whom he wishes to injure by them. And because God, when He created
him, was certainly not ignorant of his future malignity, and foresaw
the good which He Himself would bring out of his evil, therefore
says the psalm, "This leviathan whom Thou hast made to be a sport
therein,"[482] that we may see that, even while God in His goodness
created him good, He yet had already foreseen and arranged how He
would make use of him when he became wicked.


      18. _Of the beauty of the universe, which becomes, by God's
      ordinance, more brilliant by the opposition of contraries._

For God would never have created any, I do not say angel, but even
man, whose future wickedness He foreknew, unless He had equally
known to what uses in behalf of the good He could turn him, thus
embellishing the course of the ages, as it were an exquisite poem
set off with antitheses. For what are called antitheses are among
the most elegant of the ornaments of speech. They might be called in
Latin "oppositions," or, to speak more accurately, "contrapositions;"
but this word is not in common use among us,[483] though the Latin,
and indeed the languages of all nations, avail themselves of the same
ornaments of style. In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians the
Apostle Paul also makes a graceful use of antithesis, in that place
where he says, "By the armour of righteousness on the right hand and
on the left, by honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report:
as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying,
and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet
alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing,
and yet possessing all things."[484] As, then, these oppositions of
contraries lend beauty to the language, so the beauty of the course
of this world is achieved by the opposition of contraries, arranged,
as it were, by an eloquence not of words, but of things. This is
quite plainly stated in the Book of Ecclesiasticus, in this way:
"Good is set against evil, and life against death: so is the sinner
against the godly. So look upon all the works of the Most High, and
these are two and two, one against another."[485]


     19. _What, seemingly, we are to understand by the words, "God
                divided the light from the darkness."_

Accordingly, though the obscurity of the divine word has certainly
this advantage, that it causes many opinions about the truth to be
started and discussed, each reader seeing some fresh meaning in
it, yet, whatever is said to be meant by an obscure passage should
be either confirmed by the testimony of obvious facts, or should
be asserted in other and less ambiguous texts. This obscurity is
beneficial, whether the sense of the author is at last reached after
the discussion of many other interpretations, or whether, though
that sense remain concealed, other truths are brought out by the
discussion of the obscurity. To me it does not seem incongruous with
the working of God, if we understand that the angels were created
when that first light was made, and that a separation was made
between the holy and the unclean angels, when, as is said, "God
divided the light from the darkness; and God called the light Day,
and the darkness He called Night." For He alone could make this
discrimination, who was able also, before they fell, to foreknow that
they would fall, and that, being deprived of the light of truth, they
would abide in the darkness of pride. For, so far as regards the day
and night, with which we are familiar, He commanded those luminaries
of heaven that are obvious to our senses to divide between the light
and the darkness. "Let there be," He says, "lights in the firmament
of the heaven, to divide the day from the night;" and shortly after
He says, "And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule
the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: the stars also. And
God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the
earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
light from the darkness."[486] But between that light, which is the
holy company of the angels spiritually radiant with the illumination
of the truth, and that opposing darkness, which is the noisome
foulness of the spiritual condition of those angels who are turned
away from the light of righteousness, only He Himself could divide,
from whom their wickedness (not of nature, but of will), while yet it
was future, could not be hidden or uncertain.


      20. _Of the words which follow the separation of light and
         darkness, "And God saw the light that it was good."_

Then, we must not pass from this passage of Scripture without noticing
that when God said, "Let there be light, and there was light," it was
immediately added, "And God saw the light that it was good." No such
expression followed the statement that He separated the light from the
darkness, and called the light Day and the darkness Night, lest the
seal of His approval might seem to be set on such darkness, as well as
on the light. For when the darkness was not subject of disapprobation,
as when it was divided by the heavenly bodies from this light which our
eyes discern, the statement that God saw that it was good is inserted,
not before, but after the division is recorded. "And God set them," so
runs the passage, "in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon
the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide
the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good." For He
approved of both, because both were sinless. But where God said, "Let
there be light, and there was light; and God saw the light that it was
good;" and the narrative goes on, "and God divided the light from the
darkness: and God called the light Day, and the darkness He called
Night," there was not in this place subjoined the statement, "And God
saw that it was good," lest both should be designated good, while one
of them was evil, not by nature, but by its own fault. And therefore,
in this case, the light alone received the approbation of the Creator,
while the angelic darkness, though it had been ordained, was yet not
approved.


  21. _Of God's eternal and unchangeable knowledge and will, whereby
      all He has made pleased Him in the eternal design as well as in
      the actual result._

For what else is to be understood by that invariable refrain, "And
God saw that it was good," than the approval of the work in its
design, which is the wisdom of God? For certainly God did not in the
actual achievement of the work first learn that it was good, but,
on the contrary, nothing would have been made had it not been first
known by Him. While, therefore, He sees that that is good which, had
He not seen it before it was made, would never have been made, it
is plain that He is not discovering, but teaching that it is good.
Plato, indeed, was bold enough to say that, when the universe was
completed, God was, as it were, elated with joy.[487] And Plato was
not so foolish as to mean by this that God was rendered more blessed
by the novelty of His creation; but he wished thus to indicate that
the work now completed met with its Maker's approval, as it had while
yet in design. It is not as if the knowledge of God were of various
kinds, knowing in different ways things which as yet are not, things
which are, and things which have been. For not in our fashion does He
look forward to what is future, nor at what is present, nor back upon
what is past; but in a manner quite different and far and profoundly
remote from our way of thinking. For He does not pass from this to
that by transition of thought, but beholds all things with absolute
unchangeableness; so that of those things which emerge in time, the
future, indeed, are not yet, and the present are now, and the past no
longer are; but all of these are by Him comprehended in His stable
and eternal presence. Neither does He see in one fashion by the eye,
in another by the mind, for He is not composed of mind and body; nor
does His present knowledge differ from that which it ever was or
shall be, for those variations of time, past, present, and future,
though they alter our knowledge, do not affect His, "with whom is
no variableness, neither shadow of turning."[488] Neither is there
any growth from thought to thought in the conceptions of Him whose
spiritual vision all things which He knows are at once embraced. For
as without any movement that time can measure, He Himself moves all
temporal things, so He knows all times with a knowledge that time
cannot measure. And therefore He saw that what He had made was good,
when He saw that it was good to make it. And when He saw it made, He
had not on that account a twofold nor any way increased knowledge
of it; as if He had less knowledge before He made what He saw. For
certainly He would not be the perfect worker He is, unless His
knowledge were so perfect as to receive no addition from His finished
works. Wherefore, if the only object had been to inform us who made
the light, it had been enough to say, "God made the light;" and if
further information regarding the means by which it was made had been
intended, it would have sufficed to say, "And God said, Let there be
light, and there was light," that we might know not only that God
had made the world, but also that He had made it by the word. But
because it was right that three leading truths regarding the creature
be intimated to us, viz., who made it, by what means, and why, it is
written, "God said, Let there be light, and there was light. And God
saw the light that it was good." If, then, we ask who made it, it
was "God." If, by what means, He said "Let it be," and it was. If we
ask, why He made it, "it was good." Neither is there any author more
excellent than God, nor any skill more efficacious than the word of
God, nor any cause better than that good might be created by the good
God. This also Plato has assigned as the most sufficient reason for
the creation of the world, that good works might be made by a good
God;[489] whether he read this passage, or, perhaps, was informed of
these things by those who had read them, or, by his quick-sighted
genius, penetrated to things spiritual and invisible through the
things that are created, or was instructed regarding them by those
who had discerned them.


  22. _Of those who do not approve of certain things which are a part
      of this good creation of a good Creator, and who think that
      there is some natural evil._

This cause, however, of a good creation, namely, the goodness of
God,--this cause, I say, so just and fit, which, when piously and
carefully weighed, terminates all the controversies of those who
inquire into the origin of the world, has not been recognised by
some heretics,[490] because there are, forsooth, many things, such
as fire, frost, wild beasts, and so forth, which do not suit but
injure this thin-blooded and frail mortality of our flesh, which is
at present under just punishment. They do not consider how admirable
these things are in their own places, how excellent in their own
natures, how beautifully adjusted to the rest of creation, and how
much grace they contribute to the universe by their own contributions
as to a commonwealth; and how serviceable they are even to ourselves,
if we use them with a knowledge of their fit adaptations,--so that
even poisons, which are destructive when used injudiciously, become
wholesome and medicinal when used in conformity with their qualities
and design; just as, on the other hand, those things which give us
pleasure, such as food, drink, and the light of the sun, are found to
be hurtful when immoderately or unseasonably used. And thus divine
providence admonishes us not foolishly to vituperate things, but to
investigate their utility with care; and, where our mental capacity
or infirmity is at fault, to believe that there is a utility, though
hidden, as we have experienced that there were other things which
we all but failed to discover. For this concealment of the use of
things is itself either an exercise of our humility or a levelling
of our pride; for no nature at all is evil, and this is a name for
nothing but the want of good. But from things earthly to things
heavenly, from the visible to the invisible, there are some things
better than others; and for this purpose are they unequal, in order
that they might all exist. Now God is in such sort a great worker in
great things, that He is not less in little things,--for these little
things are to be measured not by their own greatness (which does
not exist), but by the wisdom of their Designer; as, in the visible
appearance of a man, if one eyebrow be shaved off, how nearly nothing
is taken from the body, but how much from the beauty!--for that is
not constituted by bulk, but by the proportion and arrangement of
the members. But we do not greatly wonder that persons, who suppose
that some evil nature has been generated and propagated by a kind of
opposing principle proper to it, refuse to admit that the cause of
the creation was this, that the good God produced a good creation.
For they believe that He was driven to this enterprise of creation
by the urgent necessity of repulsing the evil that warred against
Him, and that He mixed His good nature with the evil for the sake
of restraining and conquering it; and that this nature of His,
being thus shamefully polluted, and most cruelly oppressed and held
captive, He labours to cleanse and deliver it, and with all His pains
does not wholly succeed; but such part of it as could not be cleansed
from that defilement is to serve as a prison and chain of the
conquered and incarcerated enemy. The Manichæans would not drivel,
or rather, rave in such a style as this, if they believed the nature
of God to be, as it is, unchangeable and absolutely incorruptible,
and subject to no injury; and if, moreover, they held in Christian
sobriety, that the soul which has shown itself capable of being
altered for the worse by its own will, and of being corrupted by sin,
and so, of being deprived of the light of eternal truth,--that this
soul, I say, is not a part of God, nor of the same nature as God, but
is created by Him, and is far different from its Creator.


    23. _Of the error in which the doctrine of Origen is involved._

But it is much more surprising that some even of those who, with
ourselves, believe that there is one only source of all things,
and that no nature which is not divine can exist unless originated
by that Creator, have yet refused to accept with a good and simple
faith this so good and simple a reason of the world's creation,
that a good God made it good; and that the things created, being
different from God, were inferior to Him, and yet were good, being
created by none other than He. But they say that souls, though not,
indeed, parts of God, but created by Him, sinned by abandoning God;
that, in proportion to their various sins, they merited different
degrees of debasement from heaven to earth, and diverse bodies as
prison-houses; and that this is the world, and this the cause of its
creation, not the production of good things, but the restraining of
evil. Origen is justly blamed for holding this opinion. For in the
books which he entitles [Greek: peri archôn], that is, _Of origins_,
this is his sentiment, this his utterance. And I cannot sufficiently
express my astonishment, that a man so erudite and well versed in
ecclesiastical literature, should not have observed, in the first
place, how opposed this is to the meaning of this authoritative
Scripture, which, in recounting all the works of God, regularly
adds, "And God saw that it was good;" and, when all were completed,
inserts the words, "And God saw everything that He had made, and,
behold, it was very good."[491] Was it not obviously meant to be
understood that there was no other cause of the world's creation than
that good creatures should be made by a good God? In this creation,
had no one sinned, the world would have been filled and beautified
with natures good without exception; and though there is sin, all
things are not therefore full of sin, for the great majority of the
heavenly inhabitants preserve their nature's integrity. And the
sinful will, though it violated the order of its own nature, did not
on that account escape the laws of God, who justly orders all things
for good. For as the beauty of a picture is increased by well-managed
shadows, so, to the eye that has skill to discern it, the universe is
beautified even by sinners, though, considered by themselves, their
deformity is a sad blemish.

In the second place, Origen, and all who think with him, ought to
have seen that if it were the true opinion that the world was created
in order that souls might, for their sins, be accommodated with
bodies in which they should be shut up as in houses of correction,
the more venial sinners receiving lighter and more ethereal bodies,
while the grosser and graver sinners received bodies more crass and
grovelling, then it would follow that the devils, who are deepest
in wickedness, ought, rather than even wicked men, to have earthly
bodies, since these are the grossest and least ethereal of all. But
in point of fact, that we might see that the deserts of souls are
not to be estimated by the qualities of bodies, the wickedest devil
possesses an ethereal body, while man, wicked, it is true, but with
a wickedness small and venial in comparison with his, received even
before his sin a body of clay. And what more foolish assertion can
be advanced than that God, by this sun of ours, did not design to
benefit the material creation, or lend lustre to its loveliness,
and therefore created one single sun for this single world, but
that it so happened that one soul only had so sinned as to deserve
to be enclosed in such a body as it is? On this principle, if it
had chanced that not one, but two, yea, or ten, or a hundred had
sinned similarly, and with a like degree of guilt, then this world
would have one hundred suns. And that such is not the case, is due
not to the considerate foresight of the Creator, contriving the
safety and beauty of things material, but rather to the fact that
so fine a quality of sinning was hit upon by only one soul, so that
it alone has merited such a body. Manifestly persons holding such
opinions should aim at confining, not souls of which they know not
what they say, but themselves, lest they fall, and deservedly, far
indeed from the truth. And as to these three answers which I formerly
recommended when in the case of any creature the questions are put,
Who made it? By what means? Why? that it should be replied, God, By
the Word, Because it was good,--as to these three answers, it is very
questionable whether the Trinity itself is thus mystically indicated,
that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, or whether
there is some good reason for this acceptation in this passage of
Scripture,--this, I say, is questionable, and one can't be expected
to explain everything in one volume.


    24. _Of the divine Trinity, and the indications of its presence
                scattered everywhere among its works._

We believe, we maintain, we faithfully preach, that the Father
begat the Word, that is, Wisdom, by which all things were made, the
only-begotten Son, one as the Father is one, eternal as the Father
is eternal, and, equally with the Father, supremely good; and that
the Holy Spirit is the Spirit alike of Father and of Son, and is
Himself consubstantial and co-eternal with both; and that this whole
is a Trinity by reason of the individuality[492] of the persons, and
one God by reason of the indivisible divine substance, as also one
Almighty by reason of the indivisible omnipotence; yet so that, when
we inquire regarding each singly, it is said that each is God and
Almighty; and, when we speak of all together, it is said that there
are not three Gods, nor three Almighties, but one God Almighty; so
great is the indivisible unity of these Three, which requires that it
be so stated. But, whether the Holy Spirit of the Father, and of the
Son, who are both good, can be with propriety called the goodness of
both, because He is common to both, I do not presume to determine
hastily. Nevertheless, I would have less hesitation in saying that
He is the holiness of both, not as if He were a divine attribute
merely, but Himself also the divine substance, and the third person
in the Trinity. I am the rather emboldened to make this statement,
because, though the Father is a spirit, and the Son a spirit, and the
Father holy, and the Son holy, yet the third person is distinctively
called the Holy Spirit, as if He were the substantial holiness
consubstantial with the other two. But if the divine goodness is
nothing else than the divine holiness, then certainly it is a
reasonable studiousness, and not presumptuous intrusion, to inquire
whether the same Trinity be not hinted at in an enigmatical mode of
speech, by which our inquiry is stimulated, when it is written who
made each creature, and by what means, and why. For it is the Father
of the Word who said, Let there be. And that which was made when He
spoke was certainly made by means of the Word. And by the words, "God
saw that it was good," it is sufficiently intimated that God made
what was made not from any necessity, nor for the sake of supplying
any want, but solely from His own goodness, _i.e._, because it was
good. And this is stated after the creation had taken place, that
there might be no doubt that the thing made satisfied the goodness on
account of which it was made. And if we are right in understanding
that this goodness is the Holy Spirit, then the whole Trinity is
revealed to us in the creation. In this, too, is the origin, the
enlightenment, the blessedness of the holy city which is above among
the holy angels. For if we inquire whence it is, God created it; or
whence its wisdom, God illumined it; or whence its blessedness, God
is its bliss. It has its form by subsisting in Him; its enlightenment
by contemplating Him; its joy by abiding in Him. It is; it sees; it
loves. In God's eternity is its life; in God's truth its light; in
God's goodness its joy.


         25. _Of the division of philosophy into three parts._

As far as one can judge, it is for the same reason that philosophers
have aimed at a threefold division of science, or rather, were enabled
to see that there was a threefold division (for they did not invent,
but only discovered it), of which one part is called physical, another
logical, the third ethical. The Latin equivalents of these names
are now naturalized in the writings of many authors, so that these
divisions are called natural, rational, and moral, on which I have
touched slightly in the eighth book. Not that I would conclude that
these philosophers, in this threefold division, had any thought of
a trinity in God, although Plato is said to have been the first to
discover and promulgate this distribution, and he saw that God alone
could be the author of nature, the bestower of intelligence, and the
kindler of love by which life becomes good and blessed. But certain
it is that, though philosophers disagree both regarding the nature
of things, and the mode of investigating truth, and of the good to
which all our actions ought to tend, yet in these three great general
questions all their intellectual energy is spent. And though there
be a confusing diversity of opinion, every man striving to establish
his own opinion in regard to each of these questions, yet no one of
them all doubts that nature has some cause, science some method, life
some end and aim. Then, again, there are three things which every
artificer must possess if he is to effect anything,--nature, education,
practice. Nature is to be judged by capacity, education by knowledge,
practice by its fruit. I am aware that, properly speaking, fruit is
what one enjoys, use [practice] what one uses. And this seems to be
the difference between them, that we are said to _enjoy_ that which
in itself, and irrespective of other ends, delights us; to _use_ that
which we seek for the sake of some end beyond. For which reason the
things of time are to be used rather than enjoyed, that we may deserve
to enjoy things eternal; and not as those perverse creatures who would
fain enjoy money and use God,--not spending money for God's sake, but
worshipping God for money's sake. However, in common parlance, we both
use fruits and enjoy uses. For we correctly speak of the "fruits of
the field," which certainly we all use in the present life. And it was
in accordance with this usage that I said that there were three things
to be observed in a man, nature, education, practice. From these the
philosophers have elaborated, as I said, the threefold division of
that science by which a blessed life is attained: the natural having
respect to nature, the rational to education, the moral to practice.
If, then, we were ourselves the authors of our nature, we should have
generated knowledge in ourselves, and should not require to reach
it by education, _i.e._, by learning it from others. Our love, too,
proceeding from ourselves and returning to us, would suffice to make
our life blessed, and would stand in need of no extraneous enjoyment.
But now, since our nature has God as its requisite author, it is
certain that we must have Him for our teacher that we may be wise; Him,
too, to dispense to us spiritual sweetness that we may be blessed.


    26. _Of the image of the supreme Trinity, which we find in some
           sort in human nature even in its present state._

And we indeed recognise in ourselves the image of God, that is,
of the supreme Trinity, an image which, though it be not equal to
God, or rather, though it be very far removed from Him,--being
neither co-eternal, nor, to say all in a word, consubstantial with
Him,--is yet nearer to Him in nature than any other of His works,
and is destined to be yet restored, that it may bear a still closer
resemblance. For we both are, and know that we are, and delight in
our being, and our knowledge of it. Moreover, in these three things
no true-seeming illusion disturbs us; for we do not come into contact
with these by some bodily sense, as we perceive the things outside
of us,--colours, _e.g._, by seeing, sounds by hearing, smells by
smelling, tastes by tasting, hard and soft objects by touching,--of
all which sensible objects it is the images resembling them, but not
themselves which we perceive in the mind and hold in the memory, and
which excite us to desire the objects. But, without any delusive
representation of images or phantasms, I am most certain that I am,
and that I know and delight in this. In respect of these truths, I
am not at all afraid of the arguments of the Academicians, who say,
What if you are deceived? For if I am deceived, I am.[493] For he
who is not, cannot be deceived; and if I am deceived, by this same
token I am. And since I am if I am deceived, how am I deceived in
believing that I am? for it is certain that I am if I am deceived.
Since, therefore, I, the person deceived, should be, even if I were
deceived, certainly I am not deceived in this knowledge that I am.
And, consequently, neither am I deceived in knowing that I know. For,
as I know that I am, so I know this also, that I know. And when I
love these two things, I add to them a certain third thing, namely,
my love, which is of equal moment. For neither am I deceived in this,
that I love, since in those things which I love I am not deceived;
though even if these were false, it would still be true that I
_loved_ false things. For how could I justly be blamed and prohibited
from loving false things, if it were false that I loved them? But,
since they are true and real, who doubts that when they are loved,
the love of them is itself true and real? Further, as there is no one
who does not wish to be happy, so there is no one who does not wish
to be. For how can he be happy, if he is nothing?


    27. _Of existence, and knowledge of it, and the love of both._

And truly the very fact of existing is by some natural spell so
pleasant, that even the wretched are, for no other reason, unwilling
to perish; and, when they feel that they are wretched, wish not that
they themselves be annihilated, but that their misery be so. Take
even those who, both in their own esteem, and in point of fact, are
utterly wretched, and who are reckoned so, not only by wise men on
account of their folly, but by those who count themselves blessed,
and who think them wretched because they are poor and destitute,--if
any one should give these men an immortality, in which their misery
should be deathless, and should offer the alternative, that if they
shrank from existing eternally in the same misery they might be
annihilated, and exist nowhere at all, nor in any condition, on the
instant they would joyfully, nay exultantly, make election to exist
always, even in such a condition, rather than not exist at all. The
well-known feeling of such men witnesses to this. For when we see
that they fear to die, and will rather live in such misfortune than
end it by death, is it not obvious enough how nature shrinks from
annihilation? And, accordingly, when they know that they must die,
they seek, as a great boon, that this mercy be shown them, that they
may a little longer live in the same misery, and delay to end it by
death. And so they indubitably prove with what glad alacrity they
would accept immortality, even though it secured to them endless
destruction. What! do not even all irrational animals, to whom such
calculations are unknown, from the huge dragons down to the least
worms, all testify that they wish to exist, and therefore shun death
by every movement in their power? Nay, the very plants and shrubs,
which have no such life as enables them to shun destruction by
movements we can see, do not they all seek, in their own fashion,
to conserve their existence, by rooting themselves more and more
deeply in the earth, that so they may draw nourishment, and throw out
healthy branches towards the sky? In fine, even the lifeless bodies,
which want not only sensation but seminal life, yet either seek the
upper air or sink deep, or are balanced in an intermediate position,
so that they may protect their existence in that situation where they
can exist in most accordance with their nature.

And how much human nature loves the knowledge of its existence, and
how it shrinks from being deceived, will be sufficiently understood
from this fact, that every man prefers to grieve in a sane mind,
rather than to be glad in madness. And this grand and wonderful
instinct belongs to men alone of all animals; for, though some of
them have keener eyesight than ourselves for this world's light, they
cannot attain to that spiritual light with which our mind is somehow
irradiated, so that we can form right judgments of all things. For
our power to judge is proportioned to our acceptance of this light.
Nevertheless, the irrational animals, though they have not knowledge,
have certainly something resembling knowledge; whereas the other
material things are said to be sensible, not because they have
senses, but because they are the objects of our senses. Yet among
plants, their nourishment and generation have some resemblance to
sensible life. However, both these and all material things have their
causes hidden in their nature; but their outward forms, which lend
beauty to this visible structure of the world, are perceived by our
senses, so that they seem to wish to compensate for their own want
of knowledge by providing us with knowledge. But we perceive them
by our bodily senses in such a way that we do not judge of them by
these senses. For we have another and far superior sense, belonging
to the inner man, by which we perceive what things are just, and what
unjust,--just by means of an intelligible idea, unjust by the want of
it. This sense is aided in its functions neither by the eyesight, nor
by the orifice of the ear, nor by the air-holes of the nostrils, nor
by the palate's taste, nor by any bodily touch. By it I am assured
both that I am, and that I know this; and these two I love, and in
the same manner I am assured that I love them.


  28. _Whether we ought to love the love itself with which we love
      our existence and our knowledge of it, that so we may more
      nearly resemble the image of the divine Trinity._

We have said as much as the scope of this work demands regarding
these two things, to wit, our existence, and our knowledge of it, and
how much they are loved by us, and how there is found even in the
lower creatures a kind of likeness of these things, and yet with a
difference. We have yet to speak of the love wherewith they are loved,
to determine whether this love itself is loved. And doubtless it is;
and this is the proof. Because in men who are justly loved, it is
rather love itself that is loved; for he is not justly called a good
man who knows what is good, but who loves it. Is it not then obvious
that we love in ourselves the very love wherewith we love whatever
good we love? For there is also a love wherewith we love that which
we ought not to love; and this love is hated by him who loves that
wherewith he loves what ought to be loved. For it is quite possible
for both to exist in one man. And this co-existence is good for a man,
to the end that this love which conduces to our living well may grow,
and the other, which leads us to evil may decrease, until our whole
life be perfectly healed and transmuted into good. For if we were
beasts, we should love the fleshly and sensual life, and this would
be our sufficient good; and when it was well with us in respect of
it, we should seek nothing beyond. In like manner, if we were trees,
we could not, indeed, in the strict sense of the word, love anything;
nevertheless we should seem, as it were, to long for that by which
we might become more abundantly and luxuriantly fruitful. If we were
stones, or waves, or wind, or flame, or anything of that kind, we
should want, indeed, both sensation and life, yet should possess a kind
of attraction towards our own proper position and natural order. For
the specific gravity of bodies is, as it were, their love, whether they
are carried downwards by their weight, or upwards by their levity. For
the body is borne by its gravity, as the spirit by love, whithersoever
it is borne.[494] But we are men, created in the image of our Creator,
whose eternity is true, and whose truth is eternal, whose love is
eternal and true, and who Himself is the eternal, true, and adorable
Trinity, without confusion, without separation; and, therefore, while,
as we run over all the works which He has established, we may detect,
as it were, His footprints, now more and now less distinct even in
those things that are beneath us, since they could not so much as
exist, or be bodied forth in any shape, or follow and observe any law,
had they not been made by Him who supremely is, and is supremely good
and supremely wise; yet in ourselves beholding His image, let us, like
that younger son of the gospel, come to ourselves, and arise and return
to Him from whom by our sin we had departed. There our being will have
no death, our knowledge no error, our love no mishap. But now, though
we are assured of our possession of these three things, not on the
testimony of others, but by our own consciousness of their presence,
and because we see them with our own most truthful interior vision,
yet, as we cannot of ourselves know how long they are to continue, and
whether they shall never cease to be, and what issue their good or
bad use will lead to, we seek for others who can acquaint us of these
things, if we have not already found them. Of the trustworthiness
of these witnesses, there will, not now, but subsequently, be an
opportunity of speaking. But in this book let us go on as we have
begun, with God's help, to speak of the city of God, not in its state
of pilgrimage and mortality, but as it exists ever immortal in the
heavens,--that is, let us speak of the holy angels who maintain their
allegiance to God, who never were, nor ever shall be, apostate, between
whom and those who forsook light eternal and became darkness, God, as
we have already said, made at the first a separation.


  29. _Of the knowledge by which the holy angels know God in His
      essence, and by which they see the causes of His works in the
      art of the worker, before they see them in the works of the
      artist._

Those holy angels come to the knowledge of God not by audible words,
but by the presence to their souls of immutable truth, _i.e._, of
the only-begotten Word of God; and they know this Word Himself,
and the Father, and their Holy Spirit, and that this Trinity is
indivisible, and that the three persons of it are one substance,
and that there are not three Gods but one God; and this they so
know, that it is better understood by them than we are by ourselves.
Thus, too, they know the creature also, not in itself, but by this
better way, in the wisdom of God, as if in the art by which it was
created; and, consequently, they know themselves better in God than
in themselves, though they have also this latter knowledge. For
they were created, and are different from their Creator. In Him,
therefore, they have, as it were, a noonday knowledge; in themselves,
a twilight knowledge, according to our former explanations.[495] For
there is a great difference between knowing a thing in the design in
conformity to which it was made, and knowing it in itself,--_e.g._,
the straightness of lines and correctness of figures is known in one
way when mentally conceived, in another when described on paper; and
justice is known in one way in the unchangeable truth, in another in
the spirit of a just man. So is it with all other things,--as, the
firmament between the water above and below, which was called the
heaven; the gathering of the waters beneath, and the laying bare of
the dry land, and the production of plants and trees; the creation
of sun, moon, and stars; and of the animals out of the waters,
fowls, and fish, and monsters of the deep; and of everything that
walks or creeps on the earth, and of man himself, who excels all
that is on the earth,--all these things are known in one way by the
angels in the Word of God, in which they see the eternally abiding
causes and reasons according to which they were made, and in another
way in themselves: in the former, with a clearer knowledge; in the
latter, with a knowledge dimmer, and rather of the bare works than
of the design. Yet, when these works are referred to the praise and
adoration of the Creator Himself, it is as if morning dawned in the
minds of those who contemplate them.


    30. _Of the perfection of the number six, which is the first of
         the numbers which is composed of its aliquot parts._

These works are recorded to have been completed in six days (the same
day being six times repeated), because six is a perfect number,--not
because God required a protracted time, as if He could not at once
create all things, which then should mark the course of time by the
movements proper to them, but because the perfection of the works was
signified by the number six. For the number six is the first which is
made up of its own[496] parts, _i.e._, of its sixth, third, and half,
which are respectively one, two, and three, and which make a total
of six. In this way of looking at a number, those are said to be its
parts which exactly divide it, as a half, a third, a fourth, or a
fraction with any denominator,--_e.g._, four is a part of nine, but not
therefore an aliquot part; but one is, for it is the ninth part; and
three is, for it is the third. Yet these two parts, the ninth and the
third, or one and three, are far from making its whole sum of nine. So
again, in the number ten, four is a part, yet does not divide it; but
one is an aliquot part, for it is a tenth; so it has a fifth, which
is two; and a half, which is five. But these three parts, a tenth, a
fifth, and a half, or one, two, and five, added together, do not make
ten, but eight. Of the number twelve, again, the parts added together
exceed the whole; for it has a twelfth, that is, one; a sixth, or two;
a fourth, which is three; a third, which is four; and a half, which
is six. But one, two, three, four, and six make up, not twelve, but
more, viz. sixteen. So much I have thought fit to state for the sake
of illustrating the perfection of the number six, which is, as I said,
the first which is exactly made up of its own parts added together;
and in this number of days God finished His work.[497] And, therefore,
we must not despise the science of numbers, which, in many passages
of holy Scripture, is found to be of eminent service to the careful
interpreter.[498] Neither has it been without reason numbered among
God's praises, "Thou hast ordered all things in number, and measure,
and weight."[499]


     31. _Of the seventh day, in which completeness and repose are
                             celebrated._

But, on the seventh day (_i.e._, the same day repeated seven times,
which number is also a perfect one, though for another reason), the
rest of God is set forth, and then, too, we first hear of its being
hallowed. So that God did not wish to hallow this day by His works, but
by His rest, which has no evening, for it is not a creature; so that,
being known in one way in the Word of God, and in another in itself, it
should make a twofold knowledge, daylight and dusk (day and evening).
Much more might be said about the perfection of the number seven,
but this book is already too long, and I fear lest I should seem to
catch at an opportunity of airing my little smattering of science more
childishly than profitably. I must speak, therefore, in moderation and
with dignity, lest, in too keenly following "number," I be accused of
forgetting "weight" and "measure." Suffice it here to say, that three
is the first whole number that is odd, four the first that is even,
and of these two, seven is composed. On this account it is often put
for all numbers together, as, "A just man falleth seven times, and
riseth up again,"[500]--that is, let him fall never so often, he will
not perish (and this was meant to be understood not of sins, but of
afflictions conducing to lowliness). Again, "Seven times a day will I
praise Thee,"[501] which elsewhere is expressed thus, "I will bless the
Lord _at all times_."[502] And many such instances are found in the
divine authorities, in which the number seven is, as I said, commonly
used to express the whole, or the completeness of anything. And so the
Holy Spirit, of whom the Lord says, "He will teach you all truth,"[503]
is signified by this number.[504] In it is the rest of God, the rest
His people find in Him. For rest is in the whole, _i.e._ in perfect
completeness, while in the part there is labour. And thus we labour
as long as we know in part; "but when that which is perfect is come,
then that which is in part shall be done away."[505] It is even with
toil we search into the Scriptures themselves. But the holy angels,
towards whose society and assembly we sigh while in this our toilsome
pilgrimage, as they already abide in their eternal home, so do they
enjoy perfect facility of knowledge and felicity of rest. It is without
difficulty that they help us; for their spiritual movements, pure and
free, cost them no effort.


  32. _Of the opinion that the angels were created before the world._

But if some one oppose our opinion, and say that the holy angels
are not referred to when it is said, "Let there be light, and there
was light;" if he suppose or teach that some material light, then
first created, was meant, and that the angels were created, not only
before the firmament dividing the waters and named "the heaven," but
also before the time signified in the words, "In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth;" if he allege that this phrase, "In
the beginning," does not mean that nothing was made before (for the
angels were), but that God made all things by His Wisdom or Word, who
is named in Scripture "the Beginning," as He Himself, in the gospel,
replied to the Jews when they asked Him who He was, that He was the
Beginning;[506]--I will not contest the point, chiefly because it
gives me the liveliest satisfaction to find the Trinity celebrated
in the very beginning of the book of Genesis. For, having said, "In
the Beginning God created the heaven and the earth," meaning that the
Father made them in the Son (as the psalm testifies where it says,
"How manifold are Thy works, O Lord! in Wisdom hast Thou made them
all"[507]), a little afterwards mention is fitly made of the Holy
Spirit also. For, when it had been told us what kind of earth God
created at first, or what the mass or matter was which God, under
the name of "heaven and earth," had provided for the construction of
the world, as is told in the additional words, "And the earth was
without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep,"
then, for the sake of completing the mention of the Trinity, it is
immediately added, "And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters." Let each one, then, take it as he pleases; for it is so
profound a passage, that it may well suggest, for the exercise of the
reader's tact, many opinions, and none of them widely departing from
the rule of faith. At the same time, let none doubt that the holy
angels in their heavenly abodes are, though not, indeed, co-eternal
with God, yet secure and certain of eternal and true felicity. To
their company the Lord teaches that His little ones belong; and not
only says, "They shall be equal to the angels of God,"[508] but
shows, too, what blessed contemplation the angels themselves enjoy,
saying, "Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones: for
I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face
of my Father which is in heaven."[509]


  33. _Of the two different and dissimilar communities of angels,
      which are not inappropriately signified by the names light and
      darkness._

That certain angels sinned, and were thrust down to the lowest parts
of this world, where they are, as it were, incarcerated till their
final damnation in the day of judgment, the Apostle Peter very
plainly declares, when he says that "God spared not the angels that
sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains
of darkness to be reserved unto judgment."[510] Who, then, can doubt
that God, either in foreknowledge or in act, separated between these
and the rest? And who will dispute that the rest are justly called
"light?" For even we who are yet living by faith, hoping only and not
yet enjoying equality with them, are already called "light" by the
apostle: "For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the
Lord."[511] But as for these apostate angels, all who understand or
believe them to be worse than unbelieving men are well aware that
they are called "darkness." Wherefore, though light and darkness
are to be taken in their literal signification in these passages
of Genesis in which it is said, "God said, Let there be light, and
there was light," and "God divided the light from the darkness," yet,
for our part, we understand these two societies of angels,--the one
enjoying God, the other swelling with pride; the one to whom it is
said, "Praise ye Him, all His angels,"[512] the other whose prince
says, "All these things will I give Thee if Thou wilt fall down and
worship me;"[513] the one blazing with the holy love of God, the
other reeking with the unclean lust of self-advancement. And since,
as it is written, "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto
the humble,"[514] we may say, the one dwelling in the heaven of
heavens, the other cast thence, and raging through the lower regions
of the air; the one tranquil in the brightness of piety, the other
tempest-tossed with beclouding desires; the one, at God's pleasure,
tenderly succouring, justly avenging,--the other, set on by its own
pride, boiling with the lust of subduing and hurting; the one the
minister of God's goodness to the utmost of their good pleasure,
the other held in by God's power from doing the harm it would; the
former laughing at the latter when it does good unwillingly by its
persecutions, the latter envying the former when it gathers in
its pilgrims. These two angelic communities, then, dissimilar and
contrary to one another, the one both by nature good and by will
upright, the other also good by nature but by will depraved, as they
are exhibited in other and more explicit passages of holy writ, so I
think they are spoken of in this book of Genesis under the names of
light and darkness; and even if the author perhaps had a different
meaning, yet our discussion of the obscure language has not been
wasted time; for, though we have been unable to discover his meaning,
yet we have adhered to the rule of faith, which is sufficiently
ascertained by the faithful from other passages of equal authority.
For, though it is the material works of God which are here spoken
of, they have certainly a resemblance to the spiritual, so that Paul
can say, "Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the
day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."[515] If, on the other
hand, the author of Genesis saw in the words what we see, then our
discussion reaches this more satisfactory conclusion, that the man of
God, so eminently and divinely wise, or rather, that the Spirit of
God who by him recorded God's works which were finished on the sixth
day, may be supposed not to have omitted all mention of the angels,
whether he included them in the words "in the beginning," because He
made them first, or, which seems most likely, because He made them
in the only-begotten Word. And, under these names heaven and earth,
the whole creation is signified, either as divided into spiritual and
material, which seems the more likely, or into the two great parts of
the world in which all created things are contained, so that, first
of all, the creation is presented in sum, and then its parts are
enumerated according to the mystic number of the days.


  34. _Of the idea that the angels were meant where the separation
      of the waters by the firmament is spoken of, and of that other
      idea that the waters were not created._

Some,[516] however, have supposed that the angelic hosts are somehow
referred to under the name of waters, and that this is what is meant
by, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters:"[517] that
the waters above should be understood of the angels, and those below
either of the visible waters, or of the multitude of bad angels, or
of the nations of men. If this be so, then it does not here appear
when the angels were created, but when they were separated. Though
there have not been wanting men foolish and wicked enough[518] to
deny that the waters were made by God, because it is nowhere written,
"God said, Let there be waters." With equal folly they might say the
same of the earth, for nowhere do we read, "God said, Let the earth
be." But, say they, it is written, "In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth." Yes, and there the water is meant, for
both are included in one word. For "the sea is His," as the psalm
says, "and He made it; and His hands formed the dry land."[519] But
those who would understand the angels by the waters above the skies
have a difficulty about the specific gravity of the elements, and
fear that the waters, owing to their fluidity and weight, could not
be set in the upper parts of the world. So that, if they were to
construct a man upon their own principles, they would not put in his
head any moist humours, or "phlegm" as the Greeks call it, and which
acts the part of water among the elements of our body. But, in God's
handiwork, the head is the seat of the phlegm, and surely most fitly;
and yet, according to their supposition, so absurdly that if we were
not aware of the fact, and were informed by this same record that God
had put a moist and cold and therefore heavy humour in the uppermost
part of man's body, these world-weighers would refuse belief. And
if they were confronted with the authority of Scripture, they would
maintain that something else must be meant by the words. But, were we
to investigate and discover all the details which are written in this
divine book regarding the creation of the world, we should have much
to say, and should widely digress from the proposed aim of this work.
Since, then, we have now said what seemed needful regarding these two
diverse and contrary communities of angels, in which the origin of
the two human communities (of which we intend to speak anon) is also
found, let us at once bring this book also to a conclusion.

[460] Vives here notes that the Greek theologians and Jerome held,
with Plato, that spiritual creatures were made first, and used by God
in the creation of things material. The Latin theologians and Basil
held that God made all things at once.

[462] Mali enim nulla natura est: sed amissio boni, mali nomen accepit.

[463] Plutarch (_De Plac. Phil._ i. 3, and iv. 3) tells us that
this opinion was held by Anaximenes of Miletus, the followers of
Anaxagoras, and many of the Stoics. Diogenes the Cynic, as well as
Diogenes of Apollonia, seems to have adopted the same opinion. See
Zeller's _Stoics_, pp. 121 and 199.

[466] The strongly Platonic tinge of this language is perhaps best
preserved in a bare literal translation.

[467] Vives remarks that the ancients defined blessedness as an
absolutely perfect state in all good, peculiar to God. Perhaps
Augustine had a reminiscence of the remarkable discussion in the
_Tusc. Disp._ lib. v., and the definition "Neque ulla alia huic
verbo, quum beatum dicimus, subjecta notio est, nisi, secretis malis
omnibus, cumulata bonorum complexio."

how He might make it still liker its model."

[488] Jas. i. 17.

[489] The passage referred to is in the TIMÆUS, p. 29 D.: "Let us
say what was the cause of the Creator's forming this universe. He
was good; and in the good no envy is ever generated about anything
whatever. Therefore, being free from envy, He desired that all things
should, as much as possible, resemble Himself."

[493] This is one of the passages cited by Sir William Hamilton,
along with the "Cogito, ergo sum" of Descartes, in confirmation of
his proof, that in so far as we are _conscious_ of certain modes of
existence, in so far we possess an absolute certainty that we exist.
